## Computer Science: Fuzzy systems for Big Data computing

We study the interaction between fuzzy systems and Big Data and undertake the task of designing and implementing a suite of scalable fuzzy learning algorithms. The code developed is available on a [separate repository](https://github.com/antcc/fuzzyspark).

## Mathematics: Ordinary differential equations not solved for the derivative

We study ordinary differential equations in implicit form, that is, equations for which the derivative cannot be isolated. We review the standard theory of explicit ODEs, we present both algebraic and geometrical approaches to implicit equations from the general theory of differentiable mappings, and lastly we examine some classical examples such as Lagrange or Clairaut equations. A study of singular points and singular solutions that arise in implicit equations is also carried out.
