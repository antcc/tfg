By an \textit{ordinary differential equation of order $n$} we mean a relation of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ode}
F(x, y, y', \dots, y^{(n)}),
\end{equation}
where $F$ is a real-valued function of $n+1$ real variables, $x$ is an independent variable, $y=y(x)$ is an unknown function and $y', \dots, y^{(n)}$ are the first $n$ derivatives of this function with respect to $x$. When the value of $n$ is understood or simply not relevant, we will refer to \eqref{eq:ode} only as an \gls{ode}.
